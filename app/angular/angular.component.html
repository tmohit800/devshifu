<p>Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript. Angular is written in TypeScript. It implements core and optional functionality as a set of TypeScript libraries that you import into your apps.</p>

<p>The architecture of an Angular application relies on certain fundamental concepts. The basic building blocks are NgModules, which provide a compilation context for components. NgModules collect related code into functional sets; an Angular app is defined by a set of NgModules. An app always has at least a root module that enables bootstrapping, and typically has many more feature modules.</p>

<p>Components define views, which are sets of screen elements that Angular can choose among and modify according to your program logic and data.</p>

<p>Components use services, which provide specific functionality not directly related to views. Service providers can be injected into components as dependencies, making your code modular, reusable, and efficient.</p>

<p>Modules, components and services are classes that use decorators. These decorators mark their type and provide metadata that tells Angular how to use them.</p>

<p>metadata for a component class associates it with a template that defines a view. A template combines ordinary HTML with Angular directives and binding markup that allow Angular to modify the HTML before rendering it for display.</p>

<p>The metadata for a service class provides the information Angular needs to make it available to components through dependency injection (DI).</p>

<p>An app's components typically define many views, arranged hierarchically. Angular provides the Router service to help you define navigation paths among views. The router provides sophisticated in-browser navigational capabilities.</p>
