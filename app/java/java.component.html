        <h4>Steps to install Java:</h4>
        <p>To run Java code, we need two things, JRE(Java Runtime Environment) and JVM(Java Virtual Machine), but if you are
            a developer, you also need JDK(Java Development Kit) to create program. We will discuss about these concepts in
            next chapter i.e. <a href="" (click)="setPage('How Java Works Internally')">How Java Works Internally</a>.
            <br>
            We can not install JVM alone, JVM is a part of JRE. JRE is also bundled with JDK nowadays, so we just have to
            install JDK to get started.
        </p>
        <ul type="number">
            <li>
                First we will download & install JDK, to download Click on <a
                    href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html">Download JDK</a>. Click on JDK
                Download link on that page and download the version according to your system requirements. Now open the
                installer and install JDK.
            </li>
            <li>
                Now go to Environment Variables of your account,(to open this search environment variable on window search
                or right click on MyComputer, select properties, select Advanced System Settings, select Environment
                variables).
            </li>
            <li>
                In environment variables, one variable named path will be present if not create one otherwise edit that
                variable, create one entry in path by clicking on 'New' and paste bin folder location of your Java. For bin
                folder location go to C drive->Program Files->Java->jdk->bin, go inside bin folder copy the location and
                paste on environment variable named path.
            </li>
            <li>
                To check whether java is installed successfully in your system, open Command Prompt and type command javac
                -version. If java version shows, it shows java installed successfully in your system.
            </li>
            <li>
                Now we can open any text editor, write java code save it with .java extension, and then we can run it, but
                writing program on notepad is a tedious task and also it is very error prone. To solve this problem, we will
                install IDE(Integrated Development Environment) which will help us, so that we can put effort on logic
                building rather than syntax issues. These IDE will help in auto completion of code, give code
                boilerplate(pre written code), shows syntax error and in lot more things.
            </li>
            <li>
                There are many IDE's out there, you are free to choose one. We are using Eclipse for this learning. To
                download Eclipse visit <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">this link</a> and download Eclipse
                version whichever you want. We are using Enterprised Edition(EE) in our examples.
            </li>
            <li>
                Install Eclipse.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p class="text-center" style="font-style: italic;background-color: yellow;">So now, we have installed Java and IDE
            we will learn how java works internally and then we will write out first code.</p>
    </div>
    <div *ngIf="page=='HJWI'">
        <p>To understand how java works internally, we will first understand three major part of Java compiler.</p>
        <fieldset>
            <legend>JVM</legend>
            <p>
                JVM is an engine that provides a runtime environment to drive the Java Code or applications. It converts
                Java bytecode into machine language. JVM is a part of Java Run Environment (JRE). It cannot be separately
                downloaded and installed. To install JVM, you need to install JRE. The full form of JVM is Java Virtual
                Machine.
    
                In many other programming languages, the compiler produces machine code for a specific system. However, Java
                compiler produces code for a virtual machine which is called as JVM.
            </p>
        </fieldset>
        <fieldset>
            <legend>JRE</legend>
            <p>
                JRE is a piece of a software which is designed to run other software. It contains the class libraries,
                loader class, and JVM. In simple terms, if you want to run Java program you need JRE. If you are not a
                programmer, you don't need to install JDK, but just JRE to run Java programs. Though, all JDK versions comes
                bundled with Java Runtime Environment, so you do not need to download and install the JRE separately in your
                PC. The full form of JRE is Java Runtime Environment.
            </p>
        </fieldset>
        <fieldset>
            <legend>JDK</legend>
            <p>
                JDK is a software development environment used for making applets and Java applications. The full form of
                JDK is Java Development Kit. Java developers can use it on Windows, macOS, Solaris, and Linux. JDK helps
                them to code and run Java programs. It is possible to install more than one JDK version on the same
                computer.
            </p>
        </fieldset>

        <div>
            Java compiler first converts sourcecode to bytecode, an intermediate code after that JVM execute this bytecode
            to machine level code and then processing done to get required result. As bytecode is introduced in Java, this
            makes Java a platform independent language as any system having the JVM can read that bytecode and execute the
            process.
        </div>
        <fieldset>
            <p>
                This is how Java works in most simple way: When we write a piece of code and click on run, these steps are
                executed in order to get our result.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Java compiler(javac) will convert our piece of code into bytecode.
                </li>
                <li>
                    JVM will be called and convert this bytecode to machine level code.
                </li>
                <li>
                    System processor will get signals from the OS that Java program is trying to execute.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Then processor will load into memory, takes up the machine level code convert it into signals(ON or OFF)
                    and on behalf of these signals some combinational logic will occur and we get our result.
                </li>
            </ul>
